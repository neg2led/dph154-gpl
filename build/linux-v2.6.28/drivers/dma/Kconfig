	bool "DMA Engine support"
	depends on !HIGHMEM64G && HAS_DMA
	help
	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.  This menu only presents
	  DMA Device drivers supported by the configured arch, it may
	  be empty in some cases.

config INTEL_IOATDMA
	tristate "Intel I/OAT DMA support"
	depends on PCI && X86
	select DMA_ENGINE
	select DCA
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) I/OAT DMA engine present
	  in recent Intel Xeon chipsets.

	  Say Y here if you have such a chipset.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_IOP_ADMA
	tristate "Intel IOP ADMA support"
	depends on ARCH_IOP32X || ARCH_IOP33X || ARCH_IOP13XX
	select DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Enable support for the Intel(R) IOP Series RAID engines.

config DW_DMAC
	tristate "Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA support"
	depends on AVR32
	select DMA_ENGINE
	default y if CPU_AT32AP7000
	help
	  Support the Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA controller.  This
	  can be integrated in chips such as the Atmel AT32ap7000.

config PC302_DMA
    tristate "PC302 DMA support"
    depends on ARCH_PC302
    select DMA_ENGINE
    ---help---
      This driver provides support for the Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA controllers
      present on the PC302. 

config PC302_DMA_DEBUG_LEVEL
        int "PC302 driver debugging verbosity (0 = quiet, 9 = noisy)"
        default "0"
        depends on PC302_DMA
        help
          This controls the amount of debugging messages produced by the
          PC30x DMA driver. A value of zero builds a driver that has as default
          no debug code.

config FSL_DMA
	tristate "Freescale Elo and Elo Plus DMA support"
	depends on FSL_SOC
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Freescale Elo and Elo Plus DMA controllers.
	  The Elo is the DMA controller on some 82xx and 83xx parts, and the
	  Elo Plus is the DMA controller on 85xx and 86xx parts.

config MV_XOR
	bool "Marvell XOR engine support"
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	select DMA_ENGINE
	---help---
	  Enable support for the Marvell XOR engine.

config DMA_ENGINE
	bool

comment "DMA Clients"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE

config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE && NET
	default (INTEL_IOATDMA || FSL_DMA)
	help
	  This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	  offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.

	  Say Y here if you enabled INTEL_IOATDMA or FSL_DMA, otherwise
	  say N.

config DMATEST
	tristate "DMA Test client"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Simple DMA test client. Say N unless you're debugging a
	  DMA Device driver.

config PC302_DMA_TEST
    tristate "PC30x DMA test driver"
    depends on PC302_DMA && DMATEST
    ---help---
      This driver provides a number of basic tests for the DMA controllers
      present on the PC302. The tests are run on module load and can be 
      targetted to run on DMAC 0 or 1.
